This file describes differences between Vitamin C Multi-user
and Vitamin C for DOS/OS2.  Many of the concepts used in the
multi-user version will be reflected in future releases of
the DOS/OS2 version.  The goal is to have one set of functions
and conventions that is common across all supported platforms.

The two primary differences are in the areas of windows and key input.

Window differences:

In the multi-user versions, window functions return pointers to a
window structures not integers.

Vitamin C DOS/OS2
    COUNT w1,w2;
    WPTR wp;
    TEXT *wloc;
    w1 = wopen(0,0,20,79,"Vitamin C Single-user");
    w2 = wopen(5,10,15,60,"Another Window");
    wselect(w1);
    wp = &winfo[w1];
    wloc = wp->location;
    
Vitamin C Multi-user
    WPTR w1,w2;
    TEXT *wloc;
    w1 = wopen(0,0,20,79,"Vitamin C Multi-user");
    w2 = wopen(5,10,15,60,"Another Window");
    wselect(w1);
    wloc = w1->location;

All functions that require a window number in earlier versions require
a pointer to a window structure in Vitamin C Multi-user.

Keys 

In earlier versions of Vitamin C, the keys used by the input
routines are redefinable, but standard keys are not.  With 
Vitamin C Multi-user, all keys are redefinable.

Vitamin C DOS/OS2
    switch(getone())
        {
        case ESC:
            say("esc hit");
            break;
        case BTAB:
            say("back tab hit");
            break;
        }

Vitamin C Multi-user
    Could be done the same way but to be sure it would work with all
    terminals:
    
    COUNT ans;
    ans = getone();
    if(ans == vckey.esc)
        say("esc hit");
    if( ans == vckey.btab);
        say("back tab hit");

For a more detailed discussion see the keyboard documenation.

Functions that are not included:

vced                vcedclose
vcedload            vcedopen            
vcedsave

vcmhook4 -> vcmhk4
vcmhook5 -> vcmhk5
vcghook1 -> gethk1     /* might be different location */
vcghook2 -> gethk2     /* might be different location */
vcghook3 -> gethk3     /* might be different location */
vcghook4 -> gethk4     /* might be different location */
 
You may encounter other differences, especially if you rely on
the internal workings of the code.  The file "compat.vc" in this
directory may be used as a header file to help when porting from
other versions of Vitamin C.
